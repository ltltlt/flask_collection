add two statement in code:
	import flask_migrate
	...
	migrate = flask_migrate.Migrate(app, db)
	manager.add_command('db', flask_migrate.MigrateCommand)

then use 'python this.py db init' to init warehouse

when modify model, you can use 'python this.py db migrate -m "some comment"' to create migrate script in migrations/versions/

then use 'python this.py db upgrade' to upgrade the database(the row will still here)
you can also use 'python this.py db downgrade' to cut off the upgrade

note that sqlite doesn't support dropping or altering columns
but you can add:
with op.batch_alter_table('tablename') as batch_op:
    batch_op.drop_column('column')
in upgrade function, it may work(and it did work)
